> > **The unyielding foudnations rule**
> > It is easier to change a module than to change the modularity
> The reason is that once an interface has been used by another module, changing the interface requires replacing at least two modules. If an interface is used by many modules, changing it requires replacing all of those modules simultaneously. For this reason, it is particularly important to get the modularity right.
