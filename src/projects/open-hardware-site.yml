title: Open Hardware Site
subtitle: Template for building websites for open hardware projects
why: It can be challenging or costly for people without web development experience (e.g. scientists and engineers) to build user-friendly, maintainable websites for documenting and sharing their open hardware work.
what: This project is developing a Gatsby starter for building freely-hosted static websites for open hardware projects. It is first being developed to help launch websites for various open hardware projects in the Prakash Lab.
