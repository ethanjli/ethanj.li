title: Open Hardware Site
subtitle: Gatsby starter for building websites for open hardware projects
description: It can be challenging or costly for people without web development experience (e.g. scientists and engineers) to build user-friendly, maintainable websites for documenting and sharing their open hardware work. This project is developing a template for building freely-hosted static websites for open hardware projects. It is first being developed to help launch websites for various open hardware projects in the Prakash Lab.
