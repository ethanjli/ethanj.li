title: Gravity Machine
subtitle: Scale-free vertical tracking microscopy
description: The behavior and microscale processes associated with freely suspended organisms and sinking particles underlie key ecological processes in the ocean. Mechanistically studying such multiscale processes in the laboratory presents a considerable challenge for microscopy: how to measure single cells at microscale resolution, while allowing them to freely move hundreds of meters in the vertical direction? Gravity Machine is a solution in the form of a scale-free, vertical tracking microscope, based on a "hydrodynamic treadmill" with no bounds for motion along the axis of gravity.
