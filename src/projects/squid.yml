title: Squid
subtitle: Simplifying quantitative imaging platform development and deployment
why: Recent progress in microscopy hardware, software, and techniques have enabled
  new methods for making biological discoveries, yet the cost of hardware makes them
  accessible only to labs at well-resourced research institutions.
what: Squid is a full suite of modular and open-source hardware and software components
  and configurations to quickly implement portable facility-grade widefield microscopes
  and other application-specific imaging capabilities at a fraction of the cost of
  commercial solutions ($500-$10k vs. $50k-$120k).
