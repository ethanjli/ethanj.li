title: Handyfuge
subtitle: Portable, low-cost, electricity-free centrifugation
why: Centrifugation is a crucial step in many diagnostic procedures. But while many open-source designs have been proposed, no design has emerged as a standard for diagnostic use in low-resource settings.
what: Handyfuge is a proof-of-concept of a modular, safety-first design for hand-powered centrifugation. Handyfuge's modularity and compatibility with distributed manufactuing technologies will be used to investigate strategies for platform design and community-building to enable broad exploration of design variations, scale-up, and rapid adaptation and implementation of diagnostic assays for local needs.
