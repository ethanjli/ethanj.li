title: Handyfuge
subtitle: Portable, low-cost, electricity-free centrifugation
description: Centrifugation is a crucial step in many diagnostic procedures. Handyfuge is a proof-of-concept of a modular, safety-first design for hand-powered centrifugation. Handyfuge's modularity and compatibility with distributed manufactuing technologies will be used to investigate strategies for platform design and community-building to enable broad exploration of design variations, scale-up, and rapid adaptation and implementation of diagnostic assays for local needs.
